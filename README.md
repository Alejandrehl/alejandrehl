**Software Architect & Tech Lead**  
**Founder @ [KaiNext](https://www.kainext.cl)**  
**Cloud-Native Engineer · Full-Stack Developer · Product Builder**

---

I'm a software architect and product builder focused on delivering **real, scalable solutions** that solve business problems and bring measurable value.

I currently lead **KaiNext**, a software consultancy born from years of hands-on experience developing platforms, SaaS products, and automation tools. While I continue building my own technology stack, I'm also exploring opportunities to join a high-impact team as a **Software Architect, Tech Lead, or CTO**, where I can contribute everything I’ve learned — and keep growing.

I believe in building software that works: **technically sound, visually refined, and aligned with business goals**.
