## 💼 Who I Am

Senior platform engineer focused on designing and operating cloud-native systems at enterprise scale. My work centers on reliability, developer autonomy, and delivery efficiency in complex, regulated environments.

At **Thoughtworks**, I work as a Senior Consultant within LATAM Airlines' eMantto domain, focusing on platform foundations, developer self-service, and automation patterns. Alongside this role, I run **KaiNext**, a founder-led technical consulting practice where I personally execute all technical work for organizations running systems in production and startups transitioning to operational scale. My work typically sits where systems are already running, constraints are real, and failure has a visible cost.
