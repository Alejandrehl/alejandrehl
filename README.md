## 💼 Who I Am

Senior platform engineer focused on designing and operating cloud-native systems at enterprise scale. My work centers on reliability, developer autonomy, and delivery efficiency in complex, regulated environments.

At **Thoughtworks**, I work as a Senior Consultant within LATAM Airlines' eMantto domain, focusing on platform foundations, developer self-service, and automation patterns. Separately, I run **KaiNext**, a founder-led technical consulting practice where I personally execute all technical work for organizations running systems in production and startups transitioning to operational scale.
