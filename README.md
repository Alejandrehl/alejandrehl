I'm a software architect and product builder focused on delivering real, scalable solutions that solve business problems and bring measurable value.

I currently lead **KaiNext**, a software consultancy born from years of hands-on experience building platforms, SaaS products, and automation tools. While I continue developing my own projects, I'm also open to joining a high-impact team as a **Software Architect, Tech Lead, or CTO**, where I can bring everything I’ve learned into a collaborative environment.

I believe in building software that works — technically, visually, and commercially.
